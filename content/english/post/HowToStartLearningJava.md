## Setting Up the Environment

### Download and Install JDK (Java Development Kit)
JDK is the essential development toolkit for Java, allowing you to write, compile, and run Java programs. Here are the installation steps:
- Step 1: Visit the official Oracle website to download the JDK:
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html
- Step 2: Select the appropriate JDK version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- Step 3: Download the installation file and follow the instructions to install it.
- Step 4: Verify the installation by opening Terminal (or Command Prompt) and running the command:

```toml
  java -version
```

### Download and Install an IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

IDEs help developers easily write, compile, and run Java programs with a user-friendly interface. Some popular IDEs are:

IntelliJ IDEA: Popular for its friendly interface and many features that support developers.
- Download at: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/

Eclipse: Free, powerful, suitable for both beginners and experts.
- Download at: https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

VS Code: A lightweight editor that can be used with a Java plugin.
- Download at: https://code.visualstudio.com/

IntelliJ IDEA Installation Guide:
- Step 1: Download the free Community edition from the JetBrains website.
- Step 2: Install and open IntelliJ IDEA.
- Step 3: Create a new project → Select "Java" as the project type → Configure the JDK path (usually auto-detected by the IDE).
- Step 4: Start writing your first program with a Main.java file.
