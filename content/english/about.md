## About Me
Hello, I am Tran Hai Dang, a guy born and raised in Ben Tre City, a place that people call the land of coconut (or the land of Dong Khoi). Currently, I am a senior student at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, and my learning journey revolves around technology, programming, and software development.

From the first time I touched the computer keyboard, I was fascinated by the wonders that technology brings. That motivates me to constantly explore, learn and develop myself through each line of code, each project. For me, solving a technology problem is like conquering a small mountain in a long journey.

In addition to work and study, I also love playing soccer and reading books. I consider learning English an important challenge, not only to expand opportunities but also to connect with the wider world.

## Hobbies
In addition to my professional work, I also love listening to music, traveling, and playing sports. These hobbies help me relax and recharge after stressful working hours. I also often share my experiences, knowledge, and skills through blog posts like this.

## Goals
My goal is to continuously learn and share what I have learned with the community. I believe that every day is an opportunity to grow, and I always want to be a part of projects that have a great impact on the community and the world.
